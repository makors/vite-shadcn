For all designs I ask you to make, I want them to be beautiful, and not a simple cookie cutter design template. Additionally, the websites you create should be a Single Page App (SPA) with no other pages and worthy for production. 

This template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install or use other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless I request them. If required, utility packages like uuid are acceptable, but they must not be related to the UI and must be installed through `npm install`.

If you need to use any icons, use them from lucide-react.
